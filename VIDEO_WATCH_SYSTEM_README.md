# Strict Video Watching System - Anti-Cheat Implementation

## Overview
A comprehensive video watching system that prevents users from cheating by skipping forward, ensuring they watch the entire video to earn coins.

## Key Features

### 1. ✅ Anti-Skip Forward Protection
- **Real-time Position Tracking**: Monitors video playback position every 500ms
- **Automatic Reset**: If user tries to skip forward, video automatically resets to last valid position
- **Warning Messages**: Clear alerts when skip attempt is detected
- **Highest Position Tracking**: System remembers the furthest point user has legitimately watched

### 2. ✅ Active Playback Tracking
- **Play State Detection**: Watch time only counts when video is actively playing
- **Pause Support**: Users can pause and resume without losing progress
- **No Pre/Post Counting**: Timer only runs during actual video playback
- **Accurate Time Tracking**: Uses YouTube IFrame API for precise playback monitoring

### 3. ✅ 100% Completion Requirement
- **Full Video Watch**: Users must watch entire video (100%) to earn coins
- **99% Threshold**: Backend uses 99% to account for minor timing variations
- **No Partial Rewards**: Coins only credited upon complete viewing
- **Automatic Credit**: Coins instantly added to balance at completion

### 4. ✅ Progress Persistence
- **Save & Resume**: Users can stop watching and resume later from exact position
- **Database Sync**: Watch progress saved to database every update
- **Cross-Session**: Progress maintained across different login sessions
- **Visual Progress Bars**: Clear indication of how much video has been watched

## Technical Implementation

### Frontend (`Earn.jsx`)

#### YouTube IFrame API Integration
```javascript
// Load YouTube IFrame API dynamically
const tag = document.createElement('script');
tag.src = 'https://www.youtube.com/iframe_api';

// Initialize player with event handlers
playerRef.current = new window.YT.Player(iframeRef.current, {
    events: {
        onReady: onPlayerReady,
        onStateChange: onPlayerStateChange
    }
});
```

#### Anti-Skip Forward Logic
```javascript
// Check every 500ms if user is trying to skip
const currentTime = player.getCurrentTime();

if (currentTime > highestWatchedTime + 2) {
    // User tried to skip - reset position
    player.seekTo(highestWatchedTime, true);
    showWarning('Skipping forward is not allowed!');
    return;
}

// Update highest watched position
if (currentTime > highestWatchedTime) {
    setHighestWatchedTime(currentTime);
    setWatchTime(currentTime);
}
```

#### Play State Tracking
```javascript
const onPlayerStateChange = (event) => {
    if (event.data === 1) { // Playing
        setIsPlaying(true);
        startTracking(player);
    } else if (event.data === 2 || event.data === 0) { // Paused or Ended
        setIsPlaying(false);
        stopTracking();
    }
};
```

#### Automatic Completion Detection
```javascript
// Check if video reached 99% completion
if (currentTime >= videoDuration * 0.99 && videoDuration > 0) {
    stopTracking();
    submitWatchTime(selectedVideo, Math.ceil(videoDuration));
}
```

### Backend (`videos.js`)

#### Completion Threshold
```javascript
// Require 99% completion (accounts for timing variations)
const completionThreshold = video.duration * 0.99;

if (watchRecord.watchTime >= completionThreshold && !watchRecord.completed) {
    watchRecord.completed = true;
    coinsAwarded = video.coinsReward;
    
    // Update user balance
    await User.findByIdAndUpdate(
        req.user._id,
        { $inc: { coinsBalance: coinsAwarded } }
    );
    
    // Create transaction record
    await Transaction.create({
        userId: req.user._id,
        type: 'earn',
        amount: coinsAwarded,
        description: `Earned ${coinsAwarded} coins by watching "${video.title}"`,
        metadata: { videoId: video._id, watchTime: watchRecord.watchTime }
    });
}
```

#### Duplicate Prevention
```javascript
// If already completed, don't award more coins
if (watchRecord.completed) {
    return res.json({
        message: 'Video already completed',
        watchRecord,
        coinsAwarded: 0
    });
}
```

## User Experience Flow

### 1. Video Selection
```
User clicks on video from list
    ↓
System loads video at last watched position (if exists)
    ↓
Shows instructions and current progress
    ↓
User clicks play button
```

### 2. Watching Process
```
Video starts playing
    ↓
Timer begins counting (500ms intervals)
    ↓
System tracks: currentTime, highestWatchedTime
    ↓
If user tries to skip forward:
    → Video resets to highestWatchedTime
    → Warning message displayed
    ↓
If user pauses:
    → Timer stops
    → Progress saved
    ↓
If user resumes:
    → Timer continues
    → Video continues from last position
```

### 3. Completion & Reward
```
Video reaches 99% completion
    ↓
System detects completion
    ↓
Backend validates watch time
    ↓
Coins added to user balance
    ↓
Transaction record created
    ↓
Success message displayed
    ↓
Video marked as completed
    ↓
User balance updated in real-time
```

## Anti-Cheat Mechanisms

### 1. Skip Forward Detection
- **Monitor Position**: Check current playback position every 500ms
- **Compare with Highest**: If current > highest + 2 seconds → CHEAT DETECTED
- **Auto Reset**: Immediately seek back to highest valid position
- **Visual Warning**: Display clear warning message to user

### 2. Time Tracking Validation
- **Only While Playing**: Timer only active during actual playback
- **State Monitoring**: Track play/pause/ended states
- **Accurate Updates**: Use actual video position, not estimated time

### 3. Backend Verification
- **99% Threshold**: Require near-complete viewing
- **One-Time Reward**: Coins awarded only once per video
- **Database Lock**: Completed flag prevents duplicate awards
- **Transaction Log**: All earnings permanently recorded

### 4. Progress Integrity
- **Monotonic Increase**: Watch time can only increase, never decrease
- **Max Clamp**: Watch time cannot exceed video duration
- **Resume Position**: Users resume from last valid position only

## UI/UX Features

## Testing Scenarios

### ✅ Normal Watching
1. User selects video
2. Clicks play
3. Watches entire video without interruption
4. Receives coins at completion
5. Video marked as completed

### ✅ Pause & Resume
1. User starts watching
2. Pauses at 50%
3. Timer stops
4. Resumes watching
5. Timer continues
6. Completes and receives coins

### ✅ Skip Forward Attempt (Blocked)
1. User starts watching
2. Tries to drag playhead forward
3. Video resets to last valid position
4. Warning message displayed
5. Must watch from reset position

### ✅ Multiple Sessions
1. User watches 30% of video
2. Stops and saves progress
3. Logs out
4. Logs back in later
5. Resumes from 30%
6. Completes remaining 70%
7. Receives coins

### ✅ Duplicate Prevention
1. User completes video
2. Receives coins
3. Tries to watch same video again
4. System shows "Already completed"
5. No additional coins awarded

## Configuration

### Timing Settings
```javascript
// Watch position check interval
POSITION_CHECK_INTERVAL = 500ms

// Skip detection threshold
SKIP_TOLERANCE = 2 seconds

// Completion threshold
COMPLETION_THRESHOLD = 99% (0.99)

// Message auto-dismiss
MESSAGE_TIMEOUT = 5000ms
```

### Validation Rules
```javascript
// Backend completion check
if (watchTime >= duration * 0.99 && !completed) {
    awardCoins();
}

// Frontend skip detection
if (currentTime > highestTime + 2) {
    resetPosition();
}

// Progress persistence
watchRecord.watchTime = Math.min(watchTime, duration);
```

## Database Schema

### VideoWatch Model
```javascript
{
    userId: ObjectId,
    videoId: ObjectId,
    watchTime: Number,          // Seconds watched
    coinsEarned: Number,        // Coins awarded
    completed: Boolean,         // One-time flag
    lastWatchedAt: Date,        // Last activity
    watchPercentage: Number     // Calculated field
}
```

### Transaction Record
```javascript
{
    userId: ObjectId,
    type: 'earn',
    amount: Number,             // Coins awarded
    description: String,        // Video title
    metadata: {
        videoId: ObjectId,
        watchTime: Number
    },
    createdAt: Date
}
```

## Security Considerations

### 1. **Client-Side Validation**
- YouTube IFrame API provides secure playback tracking
- Cannot be easily manipulated via browser dev tools
- Real-time position monitoring

### 2. **Server-Side Verification**
- Backend validates completion threshold
- One-time coin award flag (completed: true)
- Transaction logging for audit trail

### 3. **Rate Limiting** (Future Enhancement)
- Could add max videos per day limit
- Detect suspicious rapid completion patterns
- IP-based abuse detection

### 4. **Data Integrity**
- Watch time cannot exceed video duration
- Monotonic increase enforcement
- Duplicate prevention via database constraints

## Future Enhancements

### 1. **Advanced Analytics**
- Track actual playback vs clock time ratio
- Detect browser tab switching
- Monitor playback speed changes

### 2. **Additional Restrictions**
- Require minimum browser tab focus time
- Detect muted playback
- Verify user interaction during long videos

### 3. **Reward Variations**
- Bonus coins for first-time completion
- Daily streaks for consistent watching
- Higher rewards for longer videos

### 4. **Admin Controls**
- Real-time monitoring dashboard
- Suspicious activity alerts
- Manual coin adjustment tools
